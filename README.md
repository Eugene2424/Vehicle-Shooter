# üöó Vehicle Shooter

![Preview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2955456e-0fa8-4ed4-ae50-6a6d53e329c9)

A 3D mobile game prototype developed in Unity, where players drive and shoot while enemies spawn in waves. This is not a polished product‚Äîit's a **learning project** exploring **Clean Architecture**, **SOLID principles**, and Unity development best practices.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:** I attempted to apply Clean Architecture principles throughout the project (check the `Scripts/Game/` folder). While the structure might appear formal, it's still experimental‚ÄîI‚Äôm aware I didn‚Äôt fully grasp all architectural decisions. This is primarily an exercise in learning.

## üß† Learning Objectives

This project helped me explore:

* Clean Architecture in Unity
* Separation of concerns (Application, Presentation, Infrastructure, etc.)
* Interfaces and abstraction layers
* Unity game loops, states, and command/event systems
* Dependency Injection concepts (Installers, etc.)

## üõ† Features

* Vehicle movement and turret-based shooting
* Basic enemy AI and enemy spawner
* Game state management (menu, gameplay, win/lose)
* Mobile input support
* UI screens: gameplay, menu, result, settings

        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Infrastructure/    # Services implementation (e.g. Audio, Loading)
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Presentation/      # Visual/UI code
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Installers/        # DI bindings setup (e.g., Zenject)
```


## üöß Known Gaps & Future Goals

* Clean Architecture is still WIP; some coupling or confusion may exist
* Need better separation between `Presentation` and `Application` logic
* Improve DI consistency and interface usage
* Expand enemy behaviors and add VFX
* Refactor state transitions and event bus handling

## üì± Platform

* Target: Android
* Unity Version: 2022.x or newer

## üß™ Getting Started

1. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Eugene2424/Vehicle-Shooter.git
   ```
2. Open in Unity (`Unity Hub > Add project`)
3. Load `Scenes/Boot.unity` and hit ‚ñ∂ Play

## ü§ù Acknowledgements

This project draws on concepts from:

* Clean Architecture by Robert C. Martin
* Zenject (DI framework for Unity)
* Various Unity tutorials on game state management & UI separation
